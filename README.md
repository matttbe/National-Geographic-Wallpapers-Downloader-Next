National Geographic Downloader Next
===================================

Firstly, thank you to 'rbochet' and 'comete' for their scripts to download National Geographic wallpapers!

Unfortunately they doesn't work until October 2011 and this is why I've created a new version.

How to use it?
--------------

Simply launch the script to download wallpapers of the current month: `./NGwallpapers.sh`

If you want to download all wallpapers for a few months, you can use this command `./NGwallpapers.sh YEAR MONTHS` (e.g. `./NGwallpapers.sh 2011 10 11 12` to download all wallpapers for October, November and December 2011)

Wallpapers are downloaded in the new `NGwallpapers` folder.
